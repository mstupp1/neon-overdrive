## Review

2026-10-16 final review: inspected selected art in the three-camera browser roster at native and enlarged scale. Light/dark background, opacity, hit-flash and pixel controls were checked. The complete regular roster passed the six live combat scenarios (three cameras, two looks), including elite/blackout rendering. Detailed checks and camera/symmetry limitations are recorded in `art/enemies/README.md`.
